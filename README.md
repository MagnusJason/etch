Etchy-Sketchy
Etchy-Sketchy is a simple web application that allows you to draw and doodle on a grid of squares using your mouse. Each time you move the mouse over a square, its color changes to a random RGB value, creating a colorful and dynamic drawing experience.

How to Use
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Use the range input to adjust the size of the grid. The default grid size is 16x16.
Move your mouse over the squares in the grid to draw and doodle. Each time you move the mouse over a square, its color will change to a random RGB value.
Continue drawing and doodling to your heart's content!
How It Works
Etchy-Sketchy is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file contains the structure of the web page, including the grid of squares and the range input for adjusting the grid size. The CSS file contains the styles for the web page, including the layout and appearance of the grid and the squares. The JavaScript file contains the logic for creating the grid, updating the grid size, and changing the color of the squares on mouseover.

Customization
Etchy-Sketchy is designed to be simple and easy to use, but you can customize it to suit your needs if you like. Here are some ideas:

Change the default grid size by modifying the value attribute of the range input on line 11 of index.html.
Change the colors used for the squares by modifying the background-color properties in the .square and .square:hover, .colored selectors in style.css.
Add additional functionality, such as the ability to save and load drawings or the ability to erase squares, by modifying the JavaScript code in script.js.
Credits
